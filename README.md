# DHHS_budget

After looking for a large data set that would be interesting to work with in SSMS, and would have geographical data that may translate well to a Tableau dashboard, I downloaded data from __[usaspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/custom_account_data)__.

I selected information on government spending on Health / Health care services for each of the last 3 years.  Below is an example of selected options for the year 2020:

The relevant zip files are in the __[data folder](https://github.com/mccafj/DHHS_budget/tree/main/data)__.

SQL queries involved looking primarily at the Account Balances and the Account Breakdown by Award, including budget outlay and total awards by state & congressional district.
